I saw something coll in the GSL github page (https://github.com/imatix/gsl). You will find it in the folder called examples.

It is a Finite State Machine (FSM) written in Scalable C (see Pieter Hintjens) generated by GSL tool (iMatix).

Scalable C can be found here : https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/hintjens/scalable-c/details.

But, to play with it, it is necessary to install a certain number of libraries, and more particularly, the libzmq and CSMQ libraries.

Since I did not want to do all of this stuff, I preferred to create this small patch allowing to compile it simply, and then to play with it quickly.

Have fun with this tool to understand how it works.
